## Challenges We Faced

1. **Custom Expiration Alerts**  
   Implementing personalized expiration alerts was challenging due to the varied preferences of users. We resolved this by allowing users to set custom alert timings, providing flexibility and enhancing the user experience.

2. **Coordinating Food Donation Pickups**  
   Organizing donation pickups required a robust scheduling system for real-time coordination with local shelters. To address this, we developed a scheduling feature that allowed users to set pickup times and track donations, ensuring efficient and reliable food transfer.

## How It Works

1. **Food Tracking**  
   Users can log food items and set expiration dates. GreenMeal sends alerts as items near their expiration, helping users prevent waste.

2. **Donation Listings**  
   Surplus food can be listed for donation with details like quantity and expiry date. These items are shared with local shelters and food banks.

3. **Schedule Donations**  
   Users can arrange for shelter pickups or locate drop-off points, and track the status of their donations.
